summary: My blog is born.

Welcome to my humble home. I was finally able to find the time to get a site up and running for myself. It's amazing to think about how many sites I've created for others and the companies I've worked for, yet I never took the time to make myself public. Well folks, it's time I finally live in the open world and give back to the community that has given me so much. Cheers to you, my fellow developers.

It took awhile to decide on what I wanted for this site. Too long, in fact. Why spend so much time debating instead of simply getting it done? I went back and forth between blogging platforms, designs, content management systems, etc. 

Well, they all seemed overkill. Enter a simple layout and Jekyll! What more could I ask for?
